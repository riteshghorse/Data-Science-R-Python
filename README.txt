This module contains the text mining approcahes with R.
It contains the following implementation-
  -Text mining operations
  -Calculating the tf count(text freuency count)
  -Generating a word cloud


4. Visualizations-in-Python-1 & Visualizations-in-Python-2
This module explores the data visualization option in Python with matplotlib and seaborn
Following visualizations are implemented-
  -Histograms
  -Dot Plots
  -Bar Plots
  -Line Charts
  -Pie Charts
  -Box Plots
  -Scatter Plots
  -Point Plot

Note: All Python notebooks are created on Python3 environment. 
         : It is better to install anaconda for Python3 and run these codes.
